# ResNet-vs-ViT-Adversarial-Attacks
This project benchmarks the adversarial robustness of two popular architectures — ResNet18 (CNN) and ViT-tiny (Vision Transformer) — on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The models are tested under white-box adversarial attacks to understand how different inductive biases influence robustness.
